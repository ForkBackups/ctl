CTL is an open source project and contributions are always welcome. This page contains information for prospective CTL developers, including an overview of the organization of the current code base, how to write code and documentation, and how to use the tools like Git.

Contributions are actively encouraged. Your first few contributions should ideally take the form of git-formatted changesets. After submitting several high-quality changesets, you may receive direct commit access to the [GitHub](github.com/appliedtopology/ctl) repositories.

## Organization

At this point in time, CTL is led in a manner which closely resembles that of Python or the Linux kernel: community and developer feedback and changesets are actively encouraged, but decisions are ultimately decided by the main developer of the project (in this case, [Ryan Lewis](http://rhl.io)). This role is traditionally referred to as the Benevolent Dictator. As more developers begin to more frequently contribute high-quality changesets to the library, CTL will move towards a more distributed decision-making structure. 

## Workflow

While the projectâ€™s main page is ctl.appliedtopology.org, development takes place at github.com/appliedtopology/ctl 

The most straight-forward way to contribute is to [fork CTL on GitHub](https://github.com/appliedtopology/ctl/fork) commit your proposed changes, and then to submit a pull request.
