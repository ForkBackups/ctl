#CTL depends on a number of external projects.
#Finding (perhaps installing) and using them is a graduate students nightmare
#The way we do this in CTL is as follows.
# We give the user the option to specify the locations to things manually.
# First, we use those settings.
# Second, we fall back to the CMake built in find_package() routine.
#  -- For some packages like MPI if we dont find things this way, we fail.
# Finally, for more esoteric packages, we provide scripts which: 
# 	- Install this software for the user in deps/
#	- update the appropriate environment variables in the config file.
