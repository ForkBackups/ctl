#CTL depends on a number of external projects.
#Finding (perhaps installing) and using them is a graduate students nightmare
#The way we do this in CTL is as follows.
# We give the user the option to specify the locations to things manually.
# First, we use those settings.
# Second, we fall back to the CMake built in find_package() routine.
#  -- For some packages like MPI if we dont find things this way, we fail.
# Finally, for many dependencies we provide 
#			 'make <dependency-target-name>'
#  This installs this the specified dependency for the user in dependencies
