===== README ======
Thanks for downloading The Computational Topology library!

This C++11 library provides a set of generic tools for:
	1) Generating point sets (coming soon)
	2) Building Graphs (coming soon)
	3) Building Cellular Complexes (coming soon)
	4) Computing [persistent] homology over finite fields
	5) Parallel/Distributed algorithm(s) for (4) (coming soon)

=== LICENSE ===
CTL is GPLv2+ (or later at your discretion). See LICENSE for more info. 

=== BUILDING ====
To build the library type:
	cmake .
Then assuming no errors occur:
	make

=== INSTALL ==
Coming soon:
	make install

==== USING (coming soon) ====
See tools/ for a number of examples of using the library.

See tutorial/ for a tutorial (coming soon)

==== SUBMITTING PATCHES ====
Please Do! 
We have not yet developed a formal method for handling such requests.

I ask that you follow the generic programming paradigm. 

See examples/ for template headers, and 
study the existing code for examples of what we consider good style.

Email ctal@appliedtopology.org if there are any questions on this.

Necessary, but not sufficient conditions for patch acceptance:
1) Your code compiles.
2) Your code is meets a style format similar to the rest of the library
3) You have tested and optimized your code.
4) Other library maintainers accept the code.
5) Any new dependencies are reasonable and you have taken the 
   necessary steps to ensure that the user experience will not be 
   affected.

=== BECOMING A MAINTAINER ===
First show some interest in the project, and submit some patches.
Once you have made some contribution then you can be accepted
as a maintainer.

In the future we hope to add support for:
	0) [Persistent] Co-homology
	1) Zig Zag Persistence
	2) Multidimensional Persistence
	3) Multidimensional Zig-Zag Persistence
	4) Tidy Sets
	5) Persistent Landscapes
	6) OpenGL Visualizations
	7) Bindings to other languages such as Python, MATLAB, and R

Please email: ctal@appliedtopology.org if you have any questions on 
using the library.
